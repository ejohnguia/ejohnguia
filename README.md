As a Specialist, Software Developer working at [Bell](https://www.bell.ca/) and a CS alumnus from the University of Calgary, I have a passion for both technology and continuous learning. When I'm not working, you can find me programming, playing [chess](https://lichess.org/), or diving into a good book! 📚
