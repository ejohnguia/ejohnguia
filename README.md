I'm a Specialist, Software Developer at [Bell](https://www.bell.ca/) in the in Cloud DevOps area, and I take pride in being an alumni of the University of Calgary, where I earned my degree in Computer Science. With a deep passion for technology and a strong commitment to continuous learning, I consistently seek opportunities to enhance my skills. When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll likely find me engaged in a game of [chess](https://lichess.org/) or engrossed in the pages of a captivating book! 📚
