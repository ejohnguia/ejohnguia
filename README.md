### <samp>&gt; Hi there, I'm Ezra John Guia <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20"> </samp>

I am a CPSC student at the University of Calgary, with a focus on Software Engineering and some French.
I love programming, playing video games and swimming. 🏊‍♂️

Being a software engineer is a satisfying career path that I absolutely enjoy.
The creativity in problem solving is comparable to solving little puzzles.
It is a gratifying experience and is never a dull moment.
With technology constantly evolving, it is the future.

**A little bit about myself:**
