### <samp>&gt; Hi there, I'm Ezra John Guia <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20"> </samp>

[![Linkedin Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=linkedin&labelColor=blue)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezrajohn-guia/)

I am a CPSC student at the University of Calgary, with a focus on Software Engineering and some French.
I love programming, playing chess and swimming. 🏊‍♂️

Being a software engineer is a gratifying career path that I absolutely enjoy and I look forward to see where technology takes us.
